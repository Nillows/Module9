## Installation
1. Run `NPM Init` to install the dependent node packages.
2. Launch the App by running 'node index.js' in your Terminal.

## Usage 
Once the App has launched you will be asked 5 preference questions related to the content of your README. Answer all the questions in sequential order and a README.md file will generate in the same file location as the index.js file used to launch the app once the questions have been exhausted.
